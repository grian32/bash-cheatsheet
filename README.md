# bash-cheatsheet

A small and to the point bash cheatsheet, WIP

## Contributing

PRs are very much welcome but please be mindful about the code block formatting(highlight.js is weird) and all that.

I'd also like the formatting of HTML CSS and other files to remain the same, this means no running prettier on the project or something before opening a PR.
